//// ICollisionHandler is an interface that defines a contract for all collision handlers in the game.
//// It ensures that any class implementing this interface will provide an implementation for handling collisions.
//public interface ICollisionHandler {
//    // The handleCollision method is the core functionality of this interface.
//    // It must be implemented by any class that deals with collision logic.
//    // When a collision is detected between entities in the game, this method is called to execute
//    // the specific logic associated with that collision, such as updating scores, changing entity states,
//    // or triggering game events.
